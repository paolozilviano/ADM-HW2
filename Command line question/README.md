For the command line question we provide the code of the task in *windows batch files* as shell script files (.bat).

The first rudimentary code is **commandline_original.bat** and it is the one that was initially working, the we asked ChatGPT to help us
writing a more "robust" code as asked in the exercise and it comes out that 3 lines of code were sufficient to run the code
succesfully. This code is provided in the **commandline_LLM.bat** file.
